# Exploring-Classical-Music

Welcome to my classical music explorer app! My goal with this application is for anyone to be able to explore the world of classical music no matter their level of experience with it. As a software developer who has a passion for playing double bass in orchestra, I struggle to connect my two worlds, and this is one way that I have found a connection. I hope that this provides useful information and inspires curiosity for musicians, software engineers, and others!

I would be happy to hear any comments, suggestions, or questions! You can reach me @haydenpark112@gmail.com!
